						<h3 class="major">HAVOK BIKE PARK RACE WEEKEND</h3>

						<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">

Finishing the event season with race vibes! <br><b>Saturday 20th - Sunday 21st September 2025</b></br>

We’re mixing up sections of our original trails to create a fresh downhill-style line that’s rollable yet challenging. Expect flow, speed, and a few smaller features to keep things spicy – you’ll need to keep your head in the game to pick the best lines! The track will stay completely secret until the weekend, with your first chance to ride it on Saturday during practice.
</br></br>
This will be a mates race – meaning while there’s still a competitive edge, the focus is on a fun, supportive atmosphere where everyone can push themselves and have a laugh with their mates.

					<!--      INFO ABOUT ARTICLE HTML SETUP

                                            Note: this text is greyed out, or commented out. Look next to INFO ABOUT ARTICLE HTML SETUP above,
                                            you will see <!-- and at the end of all this text you will see --> <!-- Basically anything 
                                            between --> <!-- < these > --> <!-- tags is HTML language for 'comments' and will be completely
                                            ignored when the page is loading. So if something isn't working, check it's not between comment
                                            tags.
                                            
                                            Look below, it is a template that can be used to add an article - which is HTML language
                                             here for a post (between the two <article></article> tags is where all our content will go.)
                                             
                                             The <a href="LINK.COM" class="IMAGE" is an image with a link in it.
                                             <img src="images/Trails.jpeg"> is the link to the image file.
                                             When the image is clicked, it will link you to the href="LINK.COM" in the <a> tag.
                                             </a> just closes said link tag.

                                            <h3 class="major"> PLACEHOLDER </h3> is a heading, h3 is a heading style preset,
                                            replace PLACEHOLDER with the article title.

                                            <p> is a PARAGRAPH tag, that's basically where the bulk of the text, links etc go.
                                                You can put links into this <p> tagged area (see gasser jam <p> tags for exmaple.)

                                            </article> closes the article and basically marks the end of the post.

                                            <br> will add 1 link break (same as pressing enter in Microsoft Word to go to a new line.)
                                            Do 2 of these <br> tags to add a space between lines.

                                            To check your work, open the .html file on your PC, it will open in your browser and display your SAVED changes
                                            made to the page - these are not live as you havent published them on github.

                                            Where you paste the new article is where it will appear on the webpage, code is executed top to bottom.

                                    TO MAKE A NEW ARTICLE

                                    1. Copy below from <article> to </article>
                                    2. Paste it above the non-greyed out article sections above all this commented info.
                                    3. Replace the href="websitenamehere.co.uk/example" with whatever you want the article image to link to - or leave it as facebook.
                                    4. Paste the image you want to use, into the folder named images. This 'images' folder is located in the same folder as index.html, join-us.html etc.
                                    5. Change img src="images/Trails.jpeg" link to images/NAMEOFTHEIMAGEYOUJUSTPASTED.png/jpg/whatever
                                    6. Change the PLACEHOLDER between <h3> tags with your article title
                                    7. Change the PLACEHOLDER between <p> tags with your article content.
                                    8. Check it works by opening the .html file - you must save your changed file as events.html when finaly uploading. To just test
                                    things out, you can name it whatever, eventstest.html or anything to play around, it will still work locally.
